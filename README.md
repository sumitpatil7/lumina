# 🌟 LUMINA - Language Understanding, Media Integration and Assessment
Welcome to LUMINA, a dynamic interview system that integrates text, audio, and video inputs to generate and assess questions interactively! This project is currently in Phase 1, with the final version still under development. Stay tuned for more updates!  

## 🚀 Project Overview
LUMINA aims to create a virtual interviewer capable of handling multiple input types (text, audio, video) and generating interview-quality questions. The system will assess responses in real-time using multi-modal data.

### Phase 1 Features:
🤖 Question Generation: Using a local LLM (LLaMA 3.1 8B) to generate dynamic questions based on interviewer settings.
📝 Text-based Response Handling: Candidates submit responses through text boxes after each question.
🔍 Basic Evaluation: The system evaluates candidates’ text responses based on predefined metrics.
🔧 Phase 1 focuses on text-based question generation and handling Advanced text responses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Language Model: Local LLM (LLaMA 3.1 8B)    
API: Ollama API for LLM interaction     
Frontend: HTML + JavaScript     
Backend: Python (Flask)
